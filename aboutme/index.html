    <h2>Alexandra Fern√°ndez</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Alexandra, I am from Lima, Peru. I love dancing salsa and spending time with my family. I am married, my husband angello is very supportive and we recently had our first child!!! His name is lyam!</p>
    <p>Some time ago I was working in the system area in a car company, but due to the pandemic, I chose to look for a remote job.</p>
    <p>I enjoy managing databases, programming, analyzing systems. I know that in the technology area I will be able to find a good remote or hybrid job, developing in the professional area and continuing with my family. </p>
    <p>My parents met when they were young in church and were sealed in a temple. I am a 15-year member and I was blessed to serve a full-time mission. I love the Gospel, it really blesses my life and that of my family! My favorite scripture is Helaman 5:12. It is a pleasure to be able to take this class with you, I know that we all have the same good end in mind and I am here to serve you! Have a good day!</p>
